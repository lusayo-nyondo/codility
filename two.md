you are given a data set called biopics.csv containing information on biographical movies. your task is to perform some data manipulations on the biopics data. the original biopics data are made available by the analytics website FiveThirtyEight. You will be working with a preprocessed version, available for you at biopics.csv. It contains the columns: title, country, year_release, box_office, type_of_subject, lead_actor_actress. Write a function named process_data() that takes  no arguments. The function should load the biopics data (this has been implemented for you), perform data manipulations described below and return a pandas data frame with manipulated data. Clean up the biopics data: Filter out duplicated rows, rename the variable called box_office to earnings, filter out rows for which earnings are missing, keep only movies released in the year 1990 or later, convert the type of type_of_subject and country to Categorical, Create a new variable called lead_actor_accress_known that if False if lead_actor_actress is NaN and True otherwise, Update earnings such that they are expressed in millions of dollars instead of dollars, Reorder the columns in the data frame such that they are in the following order title, year_rlease, earnings, country, type_of_subject, lead_actor_actress, lead_actor_actress_knwo, sort the rows in descending order by earnings. On top of the python standard library, you can make use of any function from the pandas and numpy packages.
